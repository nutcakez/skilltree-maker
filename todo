Display:
  - Can set width - height
  - Can figure out skill tree height/width with a full skilltree (to have borders)
  - Can set start position when opened
  - Show tooltip
  - How to handle cost conditions (ie do u have enough money to buy it?)
    - func() bool field to check/validate and spend the money
  - Effect should be also a func() field

Node:
  - Above mentioned cost related func and effect



Bug:
  - Shouldnt be able to zoom out more than whats on the offscreen. Or it will show black edge.
  - Opening up the skill tree will have the start node in focus, later the last bought skill node will be in focus
